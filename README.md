Redcap hook functions for TRACE Ethiopia

This repository is for custom REDCap Hooks created for the Ethiopia Trace project.

REDCap hook function files are installed on a per REDCap project basis.
Once you have cloned the repo you need to copy the .php files into the project specific directory on the REDCap web server (for example if project has an id of 13 then you need to create a folder named 'pid13' in the RedCap/hooks folder).
